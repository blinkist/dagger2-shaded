  kapt 'com.github.blinkist.dagger2-shaded:dagger2-shaded-compiler:2.25.4'

## Updating and building

- Change the `dagger.version` property in the parent POM to the desired value.
- Run `mvn package` to generate the JARs and use them directly in your project.
- ...or make the changes in a fork and use [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/). And open a PR if it's a new version!
